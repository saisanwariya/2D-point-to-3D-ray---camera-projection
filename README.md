# 3D to 2D Projection Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the efficiency of the implementation of 3D to 2D projection in the context of computer vision. It focuses on projecting 3D points into 2D pixel locations using camera parameters and then triangulating them back into a set of 3D scene points. The goal is to measure the error between the triangulated points and the original 3D points, providing valuable insights into the accuracy of the projection.

## Program Functionality

The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Loading Input Data**: It loads input data, including two video files, calibration information, and 3D joint data.

2. **3D to 2D Projection and Triangulation**: For each frame in the video, the program performs the following steps:
    - Reads 3D joint data (X, Y, Z coordinates and confidence values).
    - Reads camera parameters for two different views.
    - Projects 3D points into 2D pixel locations for each joint.
    - Triangulates these 2D points back into a set of 3D scene points.
    
3. **Error Measurement**: The program calculates the error between the triangulated 3D points and the original 3D points for each frame and each joint.

4. **Statistics**: It calculates various statistics for the error data, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum error for each joint and provides an overall summary.

5. **Plotting**: The program generates three plots:
    - A plot showing the correlation between average error and frame number.
    - A plot of 2D points on the first video frame.
    - A plot of 2D points on the second video frame.

6. **Profiling**: It uses MATLAB's profiler to quantify the efficiency of the implementation.

## Software Setup

To run this program, you will need the following software and data files:

- MATLAB with the Image Processing Toolbox.
- Two video files: `Subject4-Session3-24form-Full-Take4-Vue2.mp4` and `Subject4-Session3-24form-Full-Take4-Vue4.mp4`.
- Calibration information files: `vue2CalibInfo.mat` and `vue4CalibInfo.mat`.
- 3D joint data file: `Subject4-Session3-Take4_mocapJoints.mat`.

Ensure that these files are in the same directory as the MATLAB script.

## Running the Program

1. Open MATLAB.

2. Load and run the MATLAB script `3D_to_2D_Projection_Analysis.m`.

3. The program will execute, performing all the described tasks.

4. After execution, you will see the following:
    - Statistics for error measurements, both for individual joints and overall.
    - Plots illustrating the error trends and 2D point projections on video frames.
    - Profiler results for efficiency analysis.

## Notes

- This program is intended for educational and analytical purposes to assess the accuracy of 3D to 2D projection. Ensure proper data and file paths before running.

- Please adhere to the Academic Integrity Statement provided at the beginning of this readme.
